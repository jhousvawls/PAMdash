# Sales Dashboard Deployment Instructions

## Complete Fix for CSV Upload Persistence Issue

This deployment package contains the complete solution to fix the CSV upload persistence issue across browsers.

## What's Included:

1. **Updated WordPress Plugin**: `sales-dashboard-v1.2.0-final.zip`
   - Dual API system (REST API + AJAX fallback)
   - Enhanced CORS support
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Version 1.2.0 by John Housholder

2. **Updated React Dashboard**: Built production files
   - AJAX fallback for data loading
   - AJAX fallback for upload history
   - Enhanced error logging and debugging

## Deployment Steps:

### Step 1: Update WordPress Plugin
1. Go to WordPress Admin → Plugins
2. **Deactivate** the current "Sales Dashboard" plugin
3. **Delete** the old plugin completely
4. Click "Add New" → "Upload Plugin"
5. Upload `sales-dashboard-v1.2.0-final.zip`
6. **Activate** the new plugin
7. Verify it shows "Version 1.2.0 | By John Housholder"

### Step 2: Deploy Updated React App
1. Upload all files from this deployment-package folder (except this README and the .zip file) to your WordPress site
2. Replace the existing dashboard files on your server
3. The main files to upload are:
   - `index.html`
   - `static/js/main.eb7f0e1d.js`
   - `static/css/main.668a55fe.css`
   - Any other static assets

### Step 3: Test the Solution
1. **Clear browser cache** (important!)
2. Visit your dashboard: `https://pamdash.wpenginepowered.com`
3. Open browser Developer Tools (F12) → Console tab
4. **Upload a CSV file** and watch for console messages:
   - "Attempting to save to WordPress REST API..."
   - "REST API failed, trying AJAX fallback..."
   - "AJAX Response Status: 200"
   - "Successfully uploaded X sales records!"

5. **Test cross-browser persistence**:
   - Upload CSV in one browser
   - Open dashboard in another browser/incognito
   - Verify the uploaded data appears

6. **Test upload history**:
   - Click "History" button
   - Should show your upload records

## Expected Results:

✅ **CSV uploads work** using AJAX fallback when REST API fails
✅ **Data persists across all browsers** immediately after upload
✅ **Upload history displays** previous uploads
✅ **Real team data shows** instead of sample data (James Ramon, Rami Perry, etc.)
✅ **No more JSON syntax errors** in console

## Console Debugging:

After deployment, you should see these console messages:
- "Attempting to load from WordPress REST API..."
- "REST API failed for data loading, trying AJAX fallback..."
- "Attempting AJAX fallback for data loading..."
- "Successfully loaded data from WordPress!"

## Troubleshooting:

If issues persist after deployment:
1. **Clear all browser caches**
2. **Check WordPress error logs** for any plugin activation issues
3. **Verify AJAX endpoints** work by visiting:
   - `https://pamdash.wpenginepowered.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=sales_dashboard_data`
4. **Check console** for any remaining errors

## Technical Details:

The solution implements a robust dual-method approach:
- **Primary**: REST API (`/wp-json/sales/v1/`)
- **Fallback**: AJAX (`/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`)

This ensures CSV uploads work regardless of WordPress configuration issues, providing reliable cross-browser data persistence.
